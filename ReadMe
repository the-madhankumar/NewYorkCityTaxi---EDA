## 📈 Key Insights

### Trip Duration Analysis
- Most taxi trips are relatively short, with the majority under 20 minutes
- The distribution of trip durations shows a right-skewed pattern
- Some exceptionally long trips exist as outliers in the data

### Temporal Patterns
- Clear patterns emerge based on time of day and day of week
- Rush hours and weekend behaviors are visible in the data
- Seasonal variations in taxi usage throughout the year

### Geographic Distribution
- Trips are concentrated in Manhattan and surrounding boroughs
- Pickup and dropoff locations reveal popular taxi routes and destinations
